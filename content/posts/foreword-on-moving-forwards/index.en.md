&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a public promise to myself to keep pushing forward; To stop doubting every decision I make, to let myself actually commit to something. And in-fact make many commits to something, without scrapping everything I'm doing in a quiet 180 a few times a year till I'm not really sure what I'm facing anymore; I have a direction and even just the attempt to keep straight and narrow my focus with the goal of moving forwards is always going better than the treading the same ground and incidentally, accidentally digging yourself a deeper and deeper hole. Last year was about clawing out of that whole situation. To at least be able to wipe my hands and stand on my own two feet again; To ready myself to take my first actual steps on this path. As a new year begins, it's finally time to heel.
